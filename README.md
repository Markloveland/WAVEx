# WAVEx
## Experimental Spectral Wave Model Built on dolfinx

## Install instructions
1. install dolfinx
2. append WAVEx to PYTHONPATH (PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/WAVEx)

## tests
Some tests are available from ONR test bed and set up to run on TACC machines


## Issues
There is a weird thing going on with "jit timing out", in particular with the shoaling case. Need to investigate this more

## Notice:

This repo is a work in progress and should be thought of as more of a proof-of-concept than an optimized, operational scale wave model
