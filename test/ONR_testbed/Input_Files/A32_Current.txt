Weak Form=SUPG_strong                         ! method: SUPG_strong, CG_strong, SUPG, CG (note only strong is currently available if wetting/drying is on)
Theta Param=0.5                                 ! theta paramter between 0 to 1 for time stepping. 0 is explicit euler, 0.5 trapezoid, 1 is implicit euler
Mesh Type=Structured                        ! geographic mesh: Structured or Unstructured
Mesh Address=meshes/shoaling_grid.xdmf         ! location of unstructured geographic xdmf mesh (ignored if Structured)
Geographic Bounds=0,10000,0,4000                                    ! bounds for geographic mesh (ignored if unstructured option is turned on)
Geographic Cells=100,100                             ! number of cells in x and in y (ignored if unstructured)
Bathymetry=Deep                           ! bathymetry file, either xdmf or some preset strings: 'Deep', 'Uniform slope'
Currents=A32                          ! currents file, either a path to an xdmf file, or some preset strings: 'Uniform Slope', 'None'
Wet/Dry=On                                  ! Wetting/drying On or Off (turning Off with near 0 depth will cause issues)
Spectral Bounds=0.05, .25, 80, 100                  ! bounds for spectral mesh. xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax (in Hz and  in degrees (not radians))
Spectral Cells=40,24                               ! number of cells in sigma then in theta
Start Time= 0                             !
End Time=1000                             !
DT=2.0                                 ! initial time, final time, time step (seconds)
Plot Every=50                                  ! plot every n time steps
Output Folder=Outputs/A32/                        ! Output directory (can be absolute or relative to the main directory)
Boundary Type=Gaussian                            ! Boundary condition type: Right now only "Gaussian" is supported
Gaussian Params=1,0.04,0.1,90                      ! Gaussian boundary condition specifiers: HS, F_std(hz), F_pk(hz), theta_pk (degree), (ignored if not Gaussian)       
QoI=HS,Mean Dir                        ! Parameters to record (HS,Mean Dir) (No spaces!!!)
Station Params=150, 0, 4000,5000                        ! station locations in geographic space, currently only supports a line in y direction. Nstat, stat0, statfinal, x location
